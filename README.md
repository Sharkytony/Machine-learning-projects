<pre>
Project -1(Healthcare) : Kidney Stone prediction -- Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e12/data
                Applied Concepts : 1)Feature Engineering(Creating new features form existing ones).
                                   2)Data cleaning and preprocessing.(Handling Missing/Null values, Handling duplicates and Outliers)
                                   3)EDA (histograms to visualize the flow of the features w.r.t. Target, scatterplot to see the ranges distincting target,
                                   boxplot to see the outliers, heatmaps to visuallize the correlation of the data)
                                   4)Train-test-split (Splitting train and validation data )/ Could have also used Stratified Kfold 
                                   5)Model Building (Scaled The data(StandardScaler- which used zscore to scale) , Applied PCA which didnt give the expected outcome,
                                   Used imp. ML models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, RandomForestCalssifier, XGBClassifier,SVC,KNN & GNB.
                                   6)Model Training and Checking the accuracy on the Validation Data .
                                   7)Building Pipelines for scalable models including all changes made to the Data.(Using sklearn pipeline)</pre>

Project -2(Science Fiction): Spaceship Titanic Survivors Prediction -- Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data
                Applied Concepts : 1)
